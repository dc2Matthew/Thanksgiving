<h3>Thanksgiving is one the most earliest Holidays in American History going all the way 
  back to 1621. Thanksgiving became from Native American and Europeans when Europeans
  left to find new land and when they were setting up in the new land after leaving there home land and they 
  were called Pilgrims they came to
  meet the Native American and then they first meet to took time for the two groups to
  trust each other but later on once they grew to trust each other the Native Americans helped them 
  learn how to plant and grow crops. The Europeans showed and helped the Native American they more advance
  things they have and have made. The two groups talked differently but later grew a relationship and would make trades with each 
  other and thanksgiving was to symbolize the cooperation they have with each other. The two groups had the first thanksgiving once the Europeans crops grew and they
  had a celebration and they ate wild turkey, corn, squash, and venison but over time there has been
  new types of food add to thanksgiving like pumkin pie and stuffing also many more foods. During the first Thanksgiving 
  there was 90 Native Americans and 50 Pilgrims and it lasted 3 days Years later during the civil war Abraham Lincoln became president he officially made
