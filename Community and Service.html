Thanksgiving is a time to be greatful of the time you have and people you have had.
During this time people usually give out food to people that might be in need and 
that might need help from the Community One of the most common ways people 
serve their communities on Thanksgiving is by volunteering. Many organizations, like 
food banks and shelters are busy around the holiday preparing meals for people who 
might not have a Thanksgiving dinner otherwise. Volunteers help prepare food and give meals 
or donate food to these organizations and making sure that those in need can still celebrate with 
a warm meal. Also in  volunteering at food related events, people also take part in 
fundraisers and charity  which help raise money for local causes. 
These events bring people together and create a sense of unity in the community. Many individuals 
also use Thanksgiving as a time to donate clothes, money, and other resources to help those who are 
struggling.

    <h3>Food banks play a important role in helping individuals and families who are having a hard time with not having
      enough food especially during Thanksgiving.
<br>During this time, many food banks work hard to ensure 
       that everyone regardless of their situation has access to a Thanksgiving meal. Food banks collect 
       and 
      distribute 
      <br>donated food to those in need and providing a wide range of items such as canned goods, 
       fresh produce, and packaged meals. Around Thanksgiving 
      food banks often focus 
      <br>on gathering traditional 
       holiday foods like turkey, stuffing, and pie to create complete meals for families who might otherwise 
       go without. 
      Without the help from the communities they food banks won't be able
      to give out as much food because of how much food they would need and the amount of 
      people they
    would need to feed.</h3>
